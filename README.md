# Number Guessing Game

This Java program is a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and a limited number of attempts.

## How It Works

1. **Game**:
   - The player chooses the number of rounds they want to play.
   - They also set the maximum number of attempts allowed per round.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - For each round, the program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
   - The player tries to guess the number within the allowed attempts.
   - Hints are provided: if the guess is too high or too low.

3. **End of Round**:
   - If the player guesses correctly, they win the round.
   - If they run out of attempts, the correct number is revealed.

4. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends after all rounds are completed, with a message thanking the player for participating. 

This program provides an interactive, multi-round guessing game with feedback to help the player narrow down their guesses.
